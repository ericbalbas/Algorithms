## Linked Lists
- Singly Linked List ✔️
  - A linear data structure where each element points to the next, forming a sequence.
- Doubly Linked List ✔️
  - Similar to a singly linked list, but each element also points to the previous one, allowing bidirectional traversal.
- Circular Doubly Linked List ✔️
  - A doubly linked list where the last element points back to the first, forming a circular structure.

## Searching
- Linear Search ✔️
  - A simple search algorithm that checks each element in the list until the target is found or the list ends.
  - Sentinel Search ✔️ 
    - An optimization of linear search where a sentinel value is used to reduce the number of comparisons.
- Binary Search ✔️ *(recursion)* rev.01
  - A search algorithm that repeatedly divides a sorted list in half to locate a target value.
- Jump Search ✔️
  - A search algorithm that divides the list into blocks of a fixed size and performs a linear search within the block.
- Interpolation Search ✔️ *(recursion)*
  - An improved variant of binary search for uniformly distributed data, estimating the position of the target.
- Exponential Search ✔️ *(recursion)*
  - A search algorithm that finds the range where the target value lies and then performs binary search within that range.
- Fibonacci Search ✔️ *(recursion)*
  - A search algorithm similar to binary search but uses Fibonacci numbers to divide the list.
- Ternary Search ✔️ *(recursion)*
  - A search algorithm that divides the list into three parts and determines which segment contains the target.
- Sublist Search ✔️ *(OOP)*
  - An algorithm to check if one list is a sublist of another, implemented using object-oriented programming.

## Trees
- Binary Search Tree ⏳
  - A tree data structure where each node has at most two children, with the left child containing values less than the parent and the right child containing values greater.
